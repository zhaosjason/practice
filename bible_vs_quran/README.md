# Bible vs. Qu'ran
Fun little program I wrote to compare words in the bible with words in the qu'ran.

### Things to look into
Performance & Memory Alloc
 - allocate strlen(str) bytes for keys instead of constant 20 byte buffer
 - compute list of top words ahead of time and store in reverse hashtable?

Web
 - efficient enough to put of my 512MB RAM web server?
 - how can I use Express for the web server and have it interface with this code?

Java
 - write similar program in Java.  Compare runtimes.
